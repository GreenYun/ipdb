Package ipdb provides facilities for parsing IPDB files served by ipip.net, (maybe) works better than the official package. Compared to the official implementation, it provides some easier ways to look into the database, and allows you to focus more on your project without hesitation.

Getting started
---------------

- Get any IPDB database files from [ipip.net](https://www.ipip.net/product/ip.html) or somewhere else.
- API documentation are available via [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/GreenYun/ipdb) or [PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/GreenYun/ipdb).
- (optional) Know [something](docs/iptree.md) about `iptree`.
- (optional) Read the [overview](docs/ipdb-overview.md) from inside an IPDB file.
